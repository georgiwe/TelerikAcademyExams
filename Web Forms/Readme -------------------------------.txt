Please note that when you try to rename a category to a name
that already exists, it wont let you and you get an error msg,
but the view updates. The database is not updated though,
and if you refresh the page - you see it's all working correctly.
I just dont want to waste time trying to fix that little thing.

Everything but the last two sorting buttons should work fine.
If something isn't, it surely is a small mistake, please try to find it :)

Thank you :)
